MS COCO has collaborated with [fityone](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/) to provide access to downloads. As such, I use the fiftyone COCO-2017 version of the dataset for all experiments.

Note that YOLO v1 uses the PASCAL VOC dataset to train object detection. However, I train and validate all models on the COCO dataset for consitency across all models.
